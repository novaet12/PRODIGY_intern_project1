#readme

The dataset consists of the following files:
- **`train.csv`**: Contains the training data with features and target variable.
- **`test.csv`**: Contains the test data for which predictions need to be made.
- **`sample_submission.csv`**: Provides the format for the submission file.
- **`data_description.txt`**: Provides detailed descriptions of each feature in the dataset.

## Features

Key features in the dataset include:
- **MSSubClass**: Type of dwelling involved in the sale.
- **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
- **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality.
- **YearBuilt**: Original construction date.
- **GrLivArea**: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
- **SalePrice**: Target variable (only in `train.csv`).

For a full list of features, refer to [data_description.txt](data_description.txt).

## Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Analyze the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Train machine learning models using the `train.csv` dataset.
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Generate predictions for the `test.csv` dataset.
   - Save predictions to `result.csv`.

## How to Run

1. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train the model.
   - Generate predictions for the test dataset.
3. The predictions will be saved in `result.csv`.

## Requirements

Install the following Python libraries before running the notebook:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
